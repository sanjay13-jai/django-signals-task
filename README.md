# Django Signals Assignment

This project demonstrates the use of Django signals and answers questions regarding their execution in the same thread, transaction, and whether they are synchronous or asynchronous.

## Code Overview

- The **Django signal-related code** is located in the `models.py` file under the `signals_app` Django app.
- The **test cases** that demonstrate the behavior of the signals are written in the `tests.py` file in the same app.

## How to Run the Code

1. Ensure you have **Django installed** and your virtual environment activated (if applicable).
   
2. Go to the root directory of this project.

3. To run the test cases and see the output for Django signals, execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python manage.py test signals_app
